# ❤️ My Love Proposal - Valentine's Day

This is a charming and well-structured project developed in **Python** using the **CustomTkinter** library. The application features a custom graphical interface that presents a special question to the user, triggering different video responses based on their choice.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Modern UI:** Built with `customtkinter` for a sleek, rounded, and aesthetic look compared to standard Tkinter.
* **Cross-Platform:** Video handling is compatible with **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** (using `xdg-open`).
* **Ready for Bundling:** Includes a `resource_path` utility designed to handle file paths correctly even after compiling the script into an executable (`.exe` or binary) via PyInstaller.
* **Custom Theme:** Pre-configured with a romantic color palette (`#FFC0CB`) suitable for the occasion.
